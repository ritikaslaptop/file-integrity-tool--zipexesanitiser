## [‚ú®] : what it does
zipexesanitiser automatically cleans your downloads folder by removing zip archives that have already been extracted and potentially dangerous executable files. it safely moves these files to the recycle bin rather than permanently deleting them, giving you a chance to recover anything important!

perfect for : maintaining a clean downloads directory and reducing security risks from accumulated executable files üßπ

## [üéØ]: key features
- **zip cleanup**: intelligently removes zip files once their contents have been extracted(yes,it double checks!)
- **exe removal**: safely clears executable files from your downloads folder
- **recycle bin safety**: uses send2trash to move files to recycle bin instead of permanent deletion
- **user notifications**: shows a friendly message box with deletion summary
- **zero configuration**: works out-of-the-box with your downloads folder
- **lightweight**: small footprint with minimal dependencies
- **windows integration**: native windows message box notifications

## [üöÄ]: how to use
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ritikaslaptop/zipexesanitiser.git
cd zipexesanitiser

# install dependencies
pip install send2trash

# run the individual cleaners
python zip_cleaner/src/zip_cleaner.py  # to clean zip files
python exe_cleaner/src/exe_cleaner.py  # to clean executable files

# alternatively, use the pre-built executables in the builds folders(to be added soon)
```

you can also create shortcuts to run the executables with a single click, or set them up to run automatically on system startup.

## [üß†]: how it works
1. **zip file processing**:
   - locates all zip files in your downloads folder
   - checks if a folder with the same name exists (indicating extraction)
   - if extracted folder exists, moves the zip file to recycle bin

2. **exe file removal**:
   - finds all executable files in downloads folder
   - safely moves them to recycle bin
   - reports total number of removed files
